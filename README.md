# myCompanyBootstrap

This project was built around Bootstrap-a frontEnd library. I ended a few html boiler plates so
i can render it on the web. As i go along, i will try to modify some of the styling and Javascript
to make it more interactive.

It has been a pleasure learning Bootstrap such a cool Library.
